 * The Tetrad class knows the blocks that a Tetrad contains, the grid that it is in, the various
 * colors possible for blocks, as well as a semaphore that prevents concurrent modification 
 * of the block from a different threat. It can translate, rotate, add itself to a location, 
 * remove itself from a location, and make sure a location is empty before moving there.
