//IMPORTANT: KNOWN ISSUES: WORKING SEMAPHORE NEEDED!, CLEAR ROWS NEEDS TO PUSH ROWS DOWN!!!!! (comment too lol)

/*
 * This class implements the traditional game of Tetris, invented in Soviet Russia and then
 * brought over to the United States. It involves falling blocks that are able to be rotated
 * and translated; when a row is complete, it disappears and everything else is shifted down. 
 * Methods that this class implements include a zero-parameter constructor, methods that respond
 * accordingly when each of the arrow keys are pressed, a method that slowly moves the block
 * down, a method that checks whether a row is complete, a method that clears a row, and a method
 * that clears completed rows. In order to implement the key-press methods, the Tetris class 
 * inherits the methods from the ArrowListener interface - usable in a wide variety of cases.
